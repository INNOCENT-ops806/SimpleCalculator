# Calculator App

## Description
The Calculator App is a simple yet functional tool designed to perform basic mathematical calculations. The idea for this app was born out of a moment of inconvenience—on a Tuesday, while writing an exam, I found myself needing to borrow a calculator. This experience inspired me to create a reliable and readily accessible calculator that I could call my own.

## Features
